# Blockchain-Marketplace
Marketplace that runs on the Blockchain


This is a marketplace that runs on the blockchain. It allows people to list items for sale, it also allows people to purchase them on the website with cryptocurrency. Whenever someone purchases the item, they instantly become the owner. That is because this application is powered by a smart contract on the blockchain which manages the market place. It tracks who owns the items for sale, and it transfers the ownership of the items automatically anytime someone purchases them with cryptocurrency. It works like a vending machine.
